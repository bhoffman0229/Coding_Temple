# 1. Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

def hello_name(USERNAME):
    print("hello_" + USERNAME + "!")

# 2. Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

def first_odds(strt):
    while strt < 100:
        print(strt)
        strt += 2

# 3. Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    for x in a_list:
        print(sorted(a_list).pop())

my_numbs = [10,39,12,48,32]

max_num_in_list(my_numbs)



# 4. Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

    else:
        print("This is not a Leap Year")
   
    
is_leap_year(2000)  



# 5. Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.
